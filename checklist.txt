Always remember the hex is double the lenght usually so for bytes just assume its half the lenght.



make sure dont care what you are dealing with just into bytes. everything to bytes
if from hex you can use bytes.fromhex().

and for string to hex 
c = "Now that the party is jumping"
hexv = c.encode("utf-8").hex()     so its bh byte ma lane encode le and hex ma lane byte lai
try this 


you can say this hext to byte and byte to hex is nothing to worry.



The question asking single character may be you want too loop the characters as much as the lenght of bytes.
